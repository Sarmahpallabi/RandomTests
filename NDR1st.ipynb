The 42/13-5 \\n(pilot) well was designed to target reservoir sand\\ns approximately 500 m SE of the 42/13-3 well to help \\nlocate the horizontal section of the 42/13-5Z (s\\nidetrack) for optimal sand penetration. The primary \\nobjective of the 42/13-5Z well was to establish a maximum flow rate in the Carboniferous reservoir \\nfrom a horizontal well. \\n\\n \\nThe 42/13-5 pilot hole was drilled on a turnkey co\\nntract by ADTI to a depth of 7497 ft TVDss. However the reservoir section of the 42/13-5Z well wa\\ns drilled on day rate from\\n the kick off point to \\nTD.  \\n \\nOnly an LWD logging service was conducted for \\nboth the pilot hole and sidetrack because of the \\nplanned high angle of the wells (>70\\no) in the 8 ½ﬂ sections. Owing \\nto potential borehole instability \\nwithin the reservoir section, due to the presence \\nof thin coal beds, a limited formation evaluation \\nprogramme was planned consisting of only an azimut\\nhal gamma ray, azimuthal resistivity (42/13-5Z \\nonly) and a sonic log. \\nWell Results Shortly after spudding in the Chalk, difficulty ke\\neping to the planned trajectory was experienced, due \\nto a combination of cement blocks falling in on top \\nof the B.H.A., the B.H.A. design, particularly the \\nuse of two hole openers, the use of a drilling templa\\nte and firm formation. The section was finished \\nusing a plain rotary assembly which drilled without problems. \\n \\nThe majority of the formation tops were within 30 \\nft of prognosis and none of the tops penetrated were \\noutside the anticipated error margin prescribed. The most significant departure from prognosis was \\n\\nthe Basalanhydrit which was enco\\nuntered 151 ft deeper than expected.  \\n The 42/13-5 (pilot) penetrated the Top Carboniferous 18 ft deep to prognosis at 7247 ft (TVDss), the \\n\\n42/13-5Z (sidetrack) encountered the \\nTop Carboniferous at 7245 ft (TVDss). \\n Significant problems were encountered while attempting to sidetrack the 42/13-5 well because the \\nWerraanhydrit was harder than the cement with t\\nhe result that the B.H.\\nA. drilled the cement \\npreferentially to the formation. The problem was finally solved by changing out \\nthe B.H.A. to a rotary \\nsteerable assembly. The 42/13-5Z \\nwell was finally sidetracked on 28\\nth December 2008 with a kick off \\ndepth of 7925 ft MDbrt (7165 ft TVDss) recorded at the wellsite \\n\\n The sonic tool failed to record data in 42/13-5 and had to be re-run. The tool also failed to record \\nsensible data in 42/13-5Z however this fact wa\\ns not realised until after the hole had been cased and \\nthe chance to rerun the tool was lost. \\n The 42/13-5Z penetrated a total of 1186 ft (along hole) of gas bearing sand and a maximum rate of \\n25.8 mmscf/d was achieved over a 1466 ft total perforation interval on an 80/64ﬂ choke.\\n  Overall the drilling of the horizontal\\n section is considered to be a \\nmajor success in terms of both \\nreservoir sand penetration and drilling parameters. \\nEarly fears of wellbore stability due to coal \\nformations and the relatively long reservoir se\\nction were allayed as no drilling issues were \\nencountered. \\n \\n \\n '"
